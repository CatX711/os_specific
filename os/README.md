# OS specific configuration files

I'm not an expert, I learn a lot, actually every day, and I need to keep all these steps I follow in order and easy to access. That's the reason I created this repository. For **my own** need. If you find it useful, you'r welcome!

Maybe one day I'll learn how to create a script to automate all these steps... Who nows?

One day ...
