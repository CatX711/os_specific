# OS specific configuration files

This repository contains the necessary commands for a basic installation and configuration of OpenBSD

As always, the best source of inspiration is [openbsd's faq](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html).

I'm not an expert but I learn every day, and some time I need to keep all these steps I follow in order and easy to access. That's the reason I created this repository. For **my own** need. If you find it useful, you are welcome!
