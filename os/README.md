# OS specific configuration files

This repository contains files with the necessary commands for a basic installation and configuration of some operating systems. 

For openbsd:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tu2/configfiles/master/os/openbsd.txt
```

The best source of inspiration for installing/using OpenBSD is the [faq](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html).

A good install tutorial is [here](http://sohcahtoa.org.uk/openbsd.html).

[OpenBSD and ownCloud](https://homing-on-code.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/puffy-in-cloud.html?m=1).

OpenBSD as [server](http://thecyberrecce.net/2017/01/15/secure-webservers-with-openbsd-6-0-setting-up-httpd-mariadb-and-php/).

I learn every day, and some time I need to keep all these steps I follow in order and easy to access. That's the reason I created this repository! For **my own** need.
