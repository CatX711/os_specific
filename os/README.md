# OS specific configuration files

This repository contains files with the necessary commands for a basic installation and configuration of some operating systems I use. For the time being it's only about OpenBSD but more files will be added later.

For OpenBSD the best source of inspiration is [openbsd's faq](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html).

I'm not an expert but I learn every day, and some time I need to keep all these steps I follow in order and easy to access. That's the reason I created this repository. For **my own** need. If you find it useful, you are welcome!
